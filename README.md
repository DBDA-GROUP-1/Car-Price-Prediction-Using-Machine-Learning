## Car Price Prediction Using ML

# Overview-

This project analyzes used car data to understand the key factors affecting car prices and builds a machine learning model to predict car prices. The focus was on data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and deriving meaningful insights from the dataset.

# Tools Used-

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib / Seaborn
* Scikit-learn
* Jupyter Notebook

# Project Steps-

**1. Data Cleaning**

* Removed duplicates
* Handled missing values
* Converted categorical variables into numerical format

**2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

* Analyzed relationship between mileage, car age, and price
* Compared fuel types and transmission types
* Visualized price distribution

**3. Model Building**

* Applied Linear Regression model
* Evaluated performance using R² Score and MAE

---

# Key Insights-

* Car age and mileage negatively impact price
* Brand significantly influences resale value
* Diesel vehicles tend to retain better value

---

# Conclusion-

The project demonstrates how data analysis and regression modeling can be used to understand market trends and predict car prices effectively.
